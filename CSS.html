CSS - Cascade Style Sheet
<- Go Back

Intro to CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it's a language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML

CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media types

CSS code example:

span {
  color: white;
}
In this example we define that all span elements will show white text

Using this code we can see that with CSS we'll select one or many elements & set some property and value to update the way the element should look

CSS code example:

element_selector {
  property_name: property_value;
}
By working with CSS we'll be selecting elements and defining how they should look

We can also define if the style should be applied at the element, document or site level

Chrome Devtools is a great tool to use when coding CSS and JavaScript

Read the MDN CSS reference guide

Element Type selectors
The type selector matches elements by node name

It selects all elements of the given type within a document

Between { } goes CSS code

MDN type selecto doc

Selector Example

/* This selector selects all p elements */
p {
  /* CSS Code */
}

/* This selector selects all div elements */
div {
  /* CSS Code */
}

/* This selector selects all span elements */
span {
  /* CSS Code */
}
Color
The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text content and text decorations

This property accepts any CSS color value:

Named color: white, red, blue, green
RGB (Red, Green & Blue): rgb(0,0,0)
Hexadecimal color: #000000, #ffffff
MDN color property

Wikipedia RGB doc

To learn more about color models

Hexadecimal system

Example:

  /* All p elements are blue */
  p {
    color: blue;
  }

  /* All div elements are red */
  div {
    color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
  }

  /* All span elements are green */
  span {
    color: #00FF00;
  }
<p>Blue text</p>
<p>Blue &amp; <span>green</span> text</p> 
<div>Red text</div>
<div>Red &amp; <span>green</span> text</div>
<span>Green text</span>
How to apply CSS to a document
The style element contains style information for a document, or part of a document

By default, the style instructions written inside that element are expected to be CSS

The type attribute is optional and defaults to text/css if it is missing

MDN style element doc

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Using CSS in a Document</title>
    <style type="text/css">
      /* We select all the document span elements and apply the color property with a white value */
      span {
        color: white;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <span>White text</span>
    <span>White text</span>
    <span>White text</span>
  </body>
</html>
We can make our document different by only changing the color value

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Using CSS in a Document</title>
    <style type="text/css">
      /* We select all the document span elements and apply the color property with a red value */
      span {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <span>Red text</span>
    <span>Red text</span>
    <span>Red text</span>
  </body>
</html>
Practice
Exercise 1

CSS Styles
As we know we can apply css in different ways:
Document
Inline style
Site
Inline style
We can use the style attribute to apply css to only one HTML element

This attribute accepts a pair of property:value

To apply more than one style we separate the property:value with a semicolon

Example: property:value; other-property: other-value
We don't need to select the element as we are directly applying the style to it

Example:

<span style="color: white;">White text</span>
This is the most singular way to apply CSS to HTML. The style will apply only to the single element.

You would need to apply the style attribute to each element if you want more than one element with the same style

Example:

<span style="color: white;">White text</span>
<span style="color: white;">Other white text</span>
This type of selection is usefull if we only need a couple of elements

It's hard to change values if we have many items

As it's the last property that the browser reads, it's also the higher priority one

Because it is the last property read, it's a good option when you need to override styles

Practice
Exercise 2

Site styles
The link element links a HTML document with a CSS one

The CSS rules that we define in a external CSS file are going to apply for each document that we link

This is the best way to apply CSS to our sites if we have many documents and we want them to share the same look & feel

The link tag has the following attributes:

href: define the document path that you want to link
type: as we are linking CSS we use the value "text/css"
rel: as we are linking CSS we use the value "stylesheet"
Example:

filename: styles.css

span {
  color: white;
}
filename: index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Index</title>
    <!-- 
      We link the index.html file with the styles.css one
    -->
    <link href="styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <span>white text</span>
    <span>white text</span>
    <span>white text</span>
    <span>white text</span>
    <span>white text</span>
  </body>
</html>
filename: contact.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Contact</title>
    <!-- 
      If we have more than one document we can link the same style sheet
      Every rule defined on the external CSS file works here
    -->
    <link href="styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <span>Other white text</span>
    <span>Other white text</span>
    <span>Other white text</span>
    <span>Other white text</span>
    <span>Other white text</span>
  </body>
</html>
We can change the way spans look in both documents by only changing one CSS value

Example: filename: styles.css

span {
  color: red;
}
filename: index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Index</title>
    <link href="styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <span>Red Text</span>
    <span>Red Text</span>
    <span>Red Text</span>
    <span>Red Text</span>
    <span>Red Text</span>
  </body>
</html>
filename: contact.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Contact</title>
    <link href="styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <span>Other Red Text</span>
    <span>Other Red Text</span>
    <span>Other Red Text</span>
    <span>Other Red Text</span>
    <span>Other Red Text</span>
  </body>
</html>
Practice
Exercise 3

CSS Selectors
To use CSS on our site we need more ways to select elements and apply styles
By using different types of selector we can select one or many elements at the same time
For example:
The element selector (tag name) applies the style to all the elements with the same tag name
The id selector applies the style to only the element that has the id attribute
Read the MDN selectors guide
ID Selector
To select elements by id we use the # character and the element id value

MDN ID selectors doc

Example:

/* Element with id="main" */
#main {
  color: red;
}

div {
  color: blue;
}
<div id="main">Red Main Div</div>
<div>Blue div</div>
<div>Blue div</div>
Class Selector
Also we can select all elements with same class name by using a . and the element class name

MDN Class selectors doc

Example:

/* All elements that have class="red" */
.red {
  color: red;
}

div {
  color: blue;
}
<div class="red">Red Main Div</div>
<div>Blue div</div>
<div class="red">Red Main Div</div>
Both id and class selector can be even more specific by adding the element type before the id or class selector

Example:

/* Only select the div with main id */
div#main { color: red; }

/* Only select the paragraph with blue class */
p.blue { color: blue; }
<div id="main">Red Text</div>
<p class="blue">Blue Text</p>
<p> Text</p>
<div class="blue">Text</div>
Shared CSS code between selectors
In some cases we need to use the same style for more than one element and we can choose:

Create a class and apply it to both elements
Or we can add more selectors separated by a comma
Example:

.red{ color: red; }
<div class="red">Red Text</div>
<p class="red">Red Text</p>
Or

Example:

selector1, selector2 {
  /* CSS code */
}
Example:

div, p { color: red; }
<div>Red Text</div>
<p>Red Text</p>
Universal selector
The * universal selector matches elements of any type

You can use this selector to delete the browser initial styles (Many CSS libraries do it)

MDN Universal selectors doc

Example:

/* The universal selector will match all the elements and sets the color to white */
* {
  color: white;
}
<div>White div text</div>
<p>White paragraph text</p>
<span>White span text</span>
<a href="#">White link text</a>
Attribute selectors
Selects elements based on the value of the given attribute

First we select the element

Then we add brackets

Between brackets we add the attribute = value

MDN Attribute selectors doc

Example:

/* Select all a elements that have a href="#" attribute */
a[href="#"] { color: pink; }

/* Select all div elements that have the name main attribute */
div[name="main"] { color: yellow; }
<div name="main">Yellow div text</div>
<a href="#">Pink link text</a>
<a href="http://www.google.com"></a>
Practice
Exercise 4

Pseudo-classes selector
The pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s)

For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user hovers over it

For links we can use the following pseudo-classes: :link, :active, :hover & :visited

See a complete Pseudo-classes list on MDN Pseudo-classes doc

Example:

a:link {
  color: red;
}

a:active {
  color: pink;
}

a:hover {
  color: gray;
}

a:visited {
  color: green;
}
Descendant selectors
This selector is represented by a single space ( ) character & combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor element matching the first selector

It will apply to any element inside other element without being a direct dependency

MDN Descendant selectors dochttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_selectors

Example:

div a {
  color: red;
}
<div>
  <a href="#">Link inside a div</a>
  <p>
    <a href="#">Link inside a parragraph inside a div</a>
  </p>
</div>
Child selectors
Using the > selector we can select only those elements matched by the second selector that are the direct children of elements matched by the first

The child combinator > is placed between two CSS selectors.

Elements matched by the second selector must be the immediate children of the elements matched by the first selector

This is stricter than the descendant selector

Child selectors

Example:

/* Select the paragraph elements that are direct children from a div element*/
div > p {
  color: red;
}
<p>Black text</p>
<div>
  <p>Red Text</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Black Text</p></td>
    </tr>  
  </table>
  <h1>Black text</h1>
</div>
In this example we can see that this selector only affects the div child paragraph

Pseudo-elements
A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s)

We use the :: operator to select pseudo-element

These are the most used pseudo-element:

::first-line
::first-letter
::selection
::after
::before
The pseudo-elements ::after & ::before need to use a special property called content

MDN Pseudo elements docs

Example:

div::first-line {
  color: red;
}

p::first-letter {
  color: blue;
}

span::before {
  content: '1';
}

span::after {
  content: '2';
}
Adjacent sibling combinator
The + separates two selectors and matches the second element only if it immediately follows the first element, and both are children of the same parent element
Example:

p + div {
  color: red;
}
<p>Parragraph content</p>
<div>Red text sibling Div</div>
<div>Black sibling Div</div>
General sibling combinator
The ~ separates two selectors and matches the second element only if it follows the first element (though not necessarily immediately), and both are children of the same parent element

Example:

p ~ div {
  color: red;
}
<p>Parragraph content</p>
<div>Red text sibling Div</div>
<div>Red text sibling Div</div>
Practice
Exercise 5

Font
To make our site look better we can select the font that we want to use

HTML elements can have text content and we can change the way it looks

We already saw how to change the color and now it's the time to change other font properties

MDN Styling text Fundamentals

MDN Web Fonts Guide

Family
The font-family property specifies a prioritized list of one or more font family names and/or generic family names for the selected element

Values are separated by commas to indicate that they are alternatives

We need to add double quotes if the font-family name has spaces in it. Example: "times new roman"

The browser will select the first font in the list that is installed

If the browser can't use the first font value it will try to use the next one in the list

It's a good practice to add a generic font family just in case none of the other values works for a particular browser

By adding a default value we make sure that at least our site has a font-family style

Generic family name list: serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, fantasy, system-ui

MDN font-family doc

Fonts

Example:

body { font-family: serif; }
or

body {
  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}
or

body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
In this case the browser will try to use the first value (Times new roman or arial depending the case)

We can add a different font family that might be similar to the previous one just in case the first one doesn't work

Finaly we add a third option with a generic font-family to make the text look the way we want in some way

Web Fonts
Web fonts are a CSS feature that allows you to specify font files to be downloaded along with your website as it is accessed

Any browser that supports web fonts can have exactly the fonts you specify available to it

The @font-face CSS rule allows authors to specify fonts (online url(), and locally local()), to display text on their web pages

By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face eliminates the need to depend on the limited number of fonts users have installed on their computers

Don't forget that not all fonts are free!

To use custom fonts first we need to define it MDN font-face doc

Example:

/* We define the font Bitstream Vera Serif Bold from a external source */
@font-face {
  font-family: "Bitstream Vera Serif Bold";
  src: url("https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/2468/VeraSeBd.ttf");
}

/* In this case we define a local (our server) font */
@font-face {
  font-family: MyHelvetica;
  src: local("Helvetica Neue Bold"),
      local("HelveticaNeue-Bold"),
      url(MgOpenModernaBold.ttf);
  font-weight: bold;
}
For local fonts we need to use the src property

We can use it by name or url (path to the file)

Example:

body {
  font-family: "Bitstream Vera Serif Bold";
}

span {
  font-family: "Helvetica Neue Bold";
}
Also we can use Google fonts in our documents

First we need to select a font using the + icon

Then we'll see a dialog on the bottom righ section of the site

We'll have to use the link HTML element to add a reference to the google font site

Example:

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=IBM+Plex+Mono" rel="stylesheet">
After adding the reference we can call using the font name

Example:

body { font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; }
Google fonts does a great work to help us adding our fonts

Google fonts image

To know more about Google Fonts read the following guide

Size
The font-size property specifies the size of the font

Setting this property may change the size of other items, too, since it is used to compute the value of em, ex, and various other relative length units

Absolute value:

Pixed (px)
Point (pt): One point. 1pt = 1/72nd of 1in (used to print)
Relative values:

percentage (%:
(em): Represents the calculated font-size of the element. If font is 10px and 1em, then 2em is 20px
Viewport Height (vh): Equal to 1% of the height of the viewport's initial containing block.
Viewport Width (vw): Equal to 1% of the width of the viewport's initial containing block.
MDN font-size doc

MDN length doc

MDN percentage Doc

Read the How to size text in css a list apart guide!

Font size

Example:

/* We set the body font size in 16px using a absolute value */
body { font-size: 16px; }

/* Now the font-size is 16px so we can use a relative value like 2em to change it (32px) */
h1 { font-size: 2em; }
In the previous example if we change the body font-size it will change how every element with a relative value looks

Weight
The font-weight property specifies the weight (or boldness) of the font

The font weights available to you will depend on the font-family you are using

Some fonts are only available in normal and bold

Font weight values:

normal: same as 400
bold: same as 700
lighter: one font weight lighter than the parent element (among the available weights of the font)
bolder: one font weight heavier than the parent element (among the available weights of the font)
Number bettwen 100 & 900: numeric font weights for fonts that provide more than just normal and bold
MDN font-weight doc

CSS tricks font-weight tutorial

Example:

body {
  font-weight: normal;
}

.bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.bolder {
  font-weight: bolder;
}

div {
  font-weight: 600;
}
<body>
  <p>This span is <span class="bold">bold</span></p>
  <div>
    <p>This paragraph uses 600 font-weight and this <span class="bolder">span use 700</span></p>
  </div>
</body>
Style
The font-style CSS property specifies whether a font should be styled with a normal, italic, or oblique face from its font-family

MDN font-style doc

Stackoverflow font-style italic vs oblique

Example:

.quote { font-style: oblique; }

div { font-style: italic; }
Transform
The text-transform property specifies how to capitalize an element's text

This prorperty is text and not font as it's changing the text style and doesn't have to do with font

It can be used to make text appear in all-uppercase or all-lowercase, or with each word capitalized

MDN text-transform doc

Example:

div {
  text-transform: capitalize;
}

p {
  text-transform: lowercase;
}

span {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
Align
The text-align property describes how inline content like text is aligned in its parent block element

This property align does not control the alignment of block elements, only their inline content (just the text)

We can use the following values: inherit, left, right, center, justify, justify-all, start, end, match-parent

justify-all: works in the same way tha justify, but also forces the last line to be justified
start: same as left if direction is left-to-right and right if direction is right-to-left
end: same as right if direction is left-to-right and left if direction is right-to-left
match-parent: similar to inherit, but the values start and end are calculated according to the parent's direction and are replaced by the appropriate left or right value
MDN text-align doc

Example:

body { text-align: left; }

.right { text-align: right; }
.justify { text-align: justify; }
<body>
  <p>Normal text in a paragraph</p>
  <div class="right">This text it's aligned to the right</div>
  <div class="justify">If we add a long text it's going to be justified</div>
</body>
Decoration
Line
The text-decoration-line property sets the kind of decoration that is used on text in an element

Property values: none, underline, overline, line-through, blink

We can add more than one value to this property

MDN text-decoration-line doc

Example:

div {
  text-decoration-line: overline;
}

p {
  text-decoration-line: line-through overline ;
}
Color
The text-decoration-color property sets the color of the decorative additions to text that are specified by text-decoration-line

We can use it with underlines and overlines, strikethroughs, and wavy lines

The specified color applies to all such decorative lines in the scope of the property's value

MDN text-decoration-color doc

Example:

div {
  text-decoration-line: overline;
  text-decoration-color: red;
}
Style
The text-decoration-style property sets the style of the lines specified by text-decoration-line
The style applies to all lines that are specified; there is no way to define different styles for each of the lines defined by text-decoration-line
Property values: solid, double, dotted, dashed, wavy
MDN text-decoration-style doc
Example:

div {
  text-decoration-line: overline;
  text-decoration-color: red;
  text-decoration-style: dashed;
}
Single definition
The text-decoration property specifies the appearance of decorative lines used on text

It's a shorthand for setting one or more individual text-decoration values in a single declaration

Format syntax: text-decoration-style text-decoration-line text-decoration-color

MDN text-decoration doc

Example:

div {
  text-decoration: dashed underline red;
}

/* same as: */
div {
  text-decoration-style: dashed;
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-color: red;
}
Indent
The text-indent property specifies the amount of indentation (empty space) that is put before lines of text in a block

MDN text-indent doc

Example:

div {
  text-indent: 10px;
}

p {
  text-indent: 15%;
}
Shadow
The text-shadow property adds shadows to text

It accepts a comma-separated list of shadows to be applied to the text and any of its decorations

Each shadow is described by some combination of X and Y offsets from the element, blur radius, and color

Shadow values:

The first two length values are the offset-x and offset-y values
The third, optional, length value is the blur-radius
The color value is the shadow's color
MDN text-shadow doc

CSS3 text-shadow generator

CSS Tricks - CSS text-shadow

Example:

div{
  /* offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | color */
  text-shadow: 5px 5px 1px black; 
}
Letter Spacing
The letter-spacing property specifies the spacing behavior between text characters

MDN letter-spacing doc

Example:

p {
  letter-spacing: 3px;
}
The word-spacing property specifies the spacing behavior between tags and words

MDN word-spacing doc

Example:

div {
  word-spacing: 2px;
}
Line height
The line-height property sets the amount of space used for lines, such as in text

On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element

On non-replaced inline elements, it specifies the height that is used to calculate line box height

Property values:

normal: depends on the user agent. Desktop browsers (including Firefox) use a default value of roughly 1.2, depending on the element's font-family
number: the used value is this unitless number multiplied by the element's own font size.
The computed value is the same as the specified number
In most cases, this is the preferred way to set line-height and avoid unexpected results due to inheritance
length: is used in the calculation of the line box height
Values given in em units may produce unexpected results
percentage: relative to the font size of the element itself
The computed value is this percentage multiplied by the element's computed font size
Percentage values may produce unexpected results
MDN line-height doc

Vertical Align
The vertical-align property specifies the vertical alignment of an inline or table-cell box

This property only applies to inline and table-cell elements (you can't use it to vertically align block-level elements)

Property values: baseline, sub, super, text-top, text-bottom, middle, top, bottom

Box Model
We can think about HTML elements as a box

This concept is known as CSS box model

The CSS box model is the foundation of layout on the Web as each element is represented as a rectangular box

Box Model

The box model has 5 parts:

Content area
Padding area: refers to the inner margin of a CSS box — between the outer edge of the content box and the inner edge of the border
Border area: it sits between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the margin
Margin area: it surrounds a CSS box, and pushes up against other CSS boxes in the layout
Width & height: this properties set the width and height of the content box, which is the area in which the content of the box is displayed
MDN Introduction to the CSS box model

MDN Box model

CSS Tricks - the-css-box-model

This properties are added to define the element real width and height value

Width = width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right

Height = height + padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top + border-bottom

Older browsers used to calculate the box model in a different way and this was one of the biggest issues developers had creating layouts

Wikipedia - Internet Explorer box model bug
Border:
The border property is a shorthand for setting all individual border property values in a single declaration

border-width
border-style
border-color
MDN border doc

Example:

div {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
Box model border

We can also use individual property for each of the values:

border-width
border-style
border-color
Example:

div {
  border-width: 1px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: red;
}
Using the border property we set the same width, style and color for all 4 element borders

We can set individual borders for each border using the border name: left, top, right, bottom

Example:

div {
  border-top: 1px solid red;
  border-bottom: 2px solid green;
  border-left: 3px solid purple;
  border-right: 4px solid blue;
}
Box model border

Width
The border-width property is a shorthand property for setting the widths on all four sides of an element's border

When one value is specified, it applies the same width to all four sides

When two values are specified, the first width applies to the top and bottom, the second to the left and right

When three values are specified, the first width applies to the top, the second to the left and right, the third to the bottom

When four values are specified, the widths apply to the top, right, bottom, and left in that order (clockwise)

Many CSS properties works this way

We can also set keyword values using: thin, medium & thick

MDN border-width doc

Example:

/* All borders width are set to 2px */
div {
  border-width: 2px;
}

/* Top, Bottom are set to 2px and left, right to 3px */
p {
  border-width: 2px 3px;
}

/* Top is set to 2px, left &  right to 3px and finaly bottom is set to 1px */
span {
  border-width: 2px 3px 1px;
}

/* top: 2px, right: 3px, bottom: 4px and left: 5px */
a {
  border-width: 2px 3px 4px 5px;
}
Style
The border-style property is a shorthand property that sets the line style for all four sides of an element's border

We can set from one to four individual values like we do with the border-width property

Property values: none, hidden, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset

MDN border-style doc

Example:

/* All borders set to dotted */
div {
  border-width: dotted;
}
Color
The border-color property is a shorthand property for setting the colors on all four sides of an element's border

MDN border-color doc

Example:

div {
  border-color: blue;
}
Each of this property can use the border name to set the property value to each individual border:

Example:

/* We can use the border properties shortcuts or use individual values for each property and border type */
div {
  border: 1px solid red;

  border-top: 1px solid red;
  border-bottom: 1px solid red;
  border-left: 1px solid red;
  border-right: 1px solid red;

  border-top-width: 1px;
  border-bottom-width: 1px;
  border-left-width: 1px;
  border-right-width: 1px;

  border-top-style: solid;
  border-bottom-style: solid;
  border-left-style: solid;
  border-right-style: solid;

  border-top-color: red;
  border-bottom-color: red;
  border-left-color: red;
  border-right-color: red;
}
Border Radius
The border-radius property lets you round the corners of an element's outer border edge

You can specify a single radius to make circular corners, or two radii to make elliptical corners

Property values: one, two, three, or four length or percentage values

MDN border-radius doc

Border radius generator

Example:

div {
  /* Radius is set for all 4 sides */
  border-radius: 10px;
}

p {
  /* top-left-and-bottom-right | top-right-and-bottom-left */
  border-radius: 10px 5%;
}

section {
  /* top-left | top-right-and-bottom-left | bottom-right */
  border-radius: 2px 4px 2px;
}

a {
  /* top-left | top-right | bottom-right | bottom-left */
  border-radius: 1px 0 3px 4px;
}
This property is a shorthand to set the four properties:

border-top-left-radius
border-top-right-radius
border-bottom-right-radius
border-bottom-left-radius
Example:

div {
  border-top-left-radius: 10px;
  border-top-right-radius: 10px;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;
}
Now we can set the border width, style, color & radius

Example:

div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  border-radius: 40px 50px;
}
Practice
Exercise 8

Padding
The padding property defines the innermost portion of the box model, creating space around an element's content, inside of any defined margins and/or borders

When one value is specified, it applies the same padding to all four sides

When two values are specified, the first padding applies to the top and bottom, the second to the left and right

When three values are specified, the first padding applies to the top, the second to the left and right, the third to the bottom

When four values are specified, the paddings apply to the top, right, bottom, and left in that order (clockwise)

MDN padding doc

CSS Tricks doc

Example:

div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  padding: 20px;
}
Padding

It is a shorthand for setting all individual paddings at once:

padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left
Example:

div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  padding-top: 20px;
  padding-right: 20px;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
  padding-left: 20px;
}
We can also use the padding property to set values for each individual side:

Example:

div {
  border: 1px solid red;

  /* top, bottom: 10px and left, right: 20px*/
  padding: 10px 20px;
  
  /* top: 10px, left, right: 20px and bottom: 30px */
  padding: 10px 20px 30px;
  
  /* top: 10px, right: 20px, bottom: 30px and left: 40px */
  padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px;
}
Margin
The margin property defines the outermost portion of the box model, creating space around an element, outside of any defined borders

Property values: same as padding

MDN margin doc

Example:

body {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  border: 2px solid purple;
}

div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  margin: 0px;
}
Margin

Example:

div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  margin: 10px;
}
Margin

It is a shorthand for setting all individual margins at once:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
Example:

div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  margin-top: 10px;
  margin-right: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  margin-left: 10px;
}
Width & Height
The width property specifies the width of an element

By default, the property defines the width of the content area
The height property specifies the height of an element

By default, the property defines the height of the content area
MDN width doc

MDN height doc

Example:

div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}
The min-width property sets the minimum width of an element

It prevents the used value of the width property from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-width
The min-height property sets the minimum height of an element

It prevents the used value of the height property from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-height.
MDN min-width doc

MDN min-height doc

Example:

div {
  min-height: 100px;
  min-width: 100px;
}
The max-width CSS property sets the maximum width of an element

It prevents the used value of the width property from becoming larger than the value specified by max-width
The max-height CSS property sets the maximum height of an element

It prevents the used value of the height property from becoming larger than the value specified for max-height
MDN max-width doc

MDN max-height doc

Example:

div {
  max-height: 300px;
  max-width: 300px;
}
Center element using auto margin
We can set the margin value to auto

By setting left and right margins to auto we can center align a element

Also we need to use the width property

We can only center elements horizontaly using this technic

Use margin auto with block elements only

To center an inline element we can always use text-align:center

Example:

div {
  width: 500px;
  /* We set the top, bottom margin to 0 and left, right to be auto */
  margin: 0 auto;
}
Practice
Exercise 9

Background color
The background-color property sets the background color of an element

This property is specified as a single color value

MDN background-color doc

Example:

div {
  background-color: #eee;
}
Also we can se the background color to be transparent

This is the value by default

Example:

div {
  background-color: transparent;
}
Content overflow
The overflow property specifies what to do when an element's content is too large to fit in its block formatting context

It is a shorthand for the overflow-x and overflow-y properties

Property values: auto, hidden & scroll

MDN overflow doc

Example:

div {
  /* x and y axis */
  overflow: scroll;

  /* Only y axis */
  overflow-y: scroll;

  /* Only y axis */
  overflow-x: scroll;
}
Box Shadow
The box-shadow property is used to add shadow effects around an element's frame

You can specify multiple effects separated by commas if you wish to do so

A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radii, and color

MDN box-shadow doc

Box shadow CSS Generator

Example:

div {
  box-shadow: 2px 3px 170px -8px rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
}
The first value is the horizontal shadow length (2px)

Second value is the vertical shadow length (3px)

Third value is the blur radius (170px)

Fourth value is the spread radius (-8px)

And the last value is the shadow color

In this example we use the rgba function that allows us to use a rgb color + alpha channel (value from 0 to 1) to set the shadow color ppacity (0.8)

Example:

div {
  box-shadow: 2px 3px 170px -8px rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
}
With this property we can also use the value inset to have an inner shadow

Example:

div {
  box-shadow: 2px 3px 170px -8px rgba(0,0,0,0.8) inset;
}
Practice
Exercise 10

Display
Every element on a web page is a rectangular box

The display property in CSS determines just how that rectangular box behaves

In HTML, default display property values are taken from behaviors described in the HTML specifications or from the browser/user default stylesheet

Property Values:

inline
block
inline-block
none
table
New values:

flex
grid
MDN display doc

CSS tricks - display property

Inline vs Block elements & inline-block

Difference block inline CSS

div {
  display: inline;
}

span {
  display: block;
}

.remove {
  display: none;
}
The value none lets you turn off the display of an element

When you use none, all descendant elements also have their display turned off

The document is rendered as though the element doesn't exist in the document tree

Practice
Exercise 11

Exercise 12

Visibility
The visibility property can show or hide an element without affecting the layout of a document

Property values: visible & hidden

/* Hide all links */
a {
  visibility: hidden;
}

/* Show all paragraphs */
p {
  visibility: visible;
}
Both display:none and visibility:hidden they look like they work in the same way but they have a difference:

display none: will remove the element
visibility hidden: will hide the element but it will still show the empty space for that element
display-none vs visibility-hidden

Exercise 13

Background Image
The background-image property sets one or more background images on an element

To set the image url we use the url(image URL or path)

MDN background-image doc

Example:

div {
  background-image: url(/path/to/the/image.png);
}
Also we can use multiple images comma separeted

Example:

div {
  background-image: url(/path/to/the/image.png), url(/path/to/the/image2.png);
}
Background Repeat
The background-repeat property defines how background images are repeated

A background image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both axes, or not repeated at all

Property values: repeat-x, repeat-y, repeat, no-repeat

Remember to use optimized size and compression images

MDN background-repeat doc

Example:

div {
  background-image: url(/path/to/the/image.png);

  /* Only use the image once */
  background-repeat: no-repeat;

  /* Only repeat the image using the x axis */
  background-repeat: repeat-x;

  /* Only repeat the image using the y axis */
  background-repeat: repeat-x;

  /* Repeat both x & y axix */
  background-repeat: repeat;
}
Background Position
The background-position property sets the initial position, relative to the background position layer defined by background-origin, for each defined background image

By default the image position is the top left corner

Property values:

The first value is for the x axis:
Length value: %, px, em
left
center
right
Second value is for the y axis:
Length value: %, px, em
top
center
bottom
MDN background-position doc

Example:

  /* This background it's going to be 10px from left to right and 20px from top to bottom */
  div {
    background-position: 10px 20px;
  }

  /* The background image is going to be centered over the x axis and at the bottom of the element */
  section {
    background-position: center bottom;
  }
We can use different values combination:

left top
left center
left bottom
center top
center center
center bottom
right top
right center
right bottom
Background Attachment
The background-attachment property determines whether that image's position is fixed within the viewport, or scrolls along with its containing block

Property values: fixed, scroll & local

MDN background-attachment

Code it down - Background attachment Demo

CSS Tricks - background-attachment

Example:

div {
  background-image: url(background.png);
  background-attachment: fixed;
}

div.scroll {
  background-image: url(background.png);
  background-attachment: scroll;
}
Background
The background property lets you adjust all background style options at once, including color, image, origin and size, repeat method, and other features:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position

Linear Gradient
The linear-gradient() is a CSS function

This function creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors along a straight line

Its result is an object of the gradient data type, which is a special kind of image.

Property values: Angle first-color second-color

MDN linear-gradient doc

Exercise 14

Exercise 15

Cursor
The cursor property specifies which mouse cursor to display when the mouse pointer is over an element

Property values: auto, crosshair, default, pointer, move, text, wait, help

We can change the cursos value to give more information about what the user can do

MDN cursor doc

Example:

body { cursor: pointer; }
button { cursor: help; }
Lists
Style type
The list-style-type property specifies the appearance of a list item element

Property values for unordered lists:

none
disc
circle
square
Property values for ordered lists:

decimal
decimal-leading-zero
lower-alpha
upper-alpha
lower-roman
upper-roman
MDN list-style-type doc

Example:

ul {
  list-style-type: none;
}

ol {
  list-style-type: decimal-leading-zero;
}
Position
The list-style-position property specifies the position of the ::marker relative to a list item

Property values: outside & inside

MDN list-style-position doc

Example:

ul {
  list-style-position: inside;
}

ol {
  list-style-position: inside;
}
Images
The list-style-image property specifies an image to be used as the list item marker

Use the url() function to set the image path/url

MDN list-style-image doc

Example:

ul {
  list-style-image: url("cat-icon.png");
}
List Style
The list-style CSS property is a shorthand for setting the individual values that define how a list is displayed:

list-style-type, list-style-image, and list-style-position
We don't have to use all values together
MDN list-style doc

Example:

ul {
  list-style: square inside;
}
ol {
  list-style: upper-roman outside;
}
Practice
Exercise 16

Tables
For tables we can use many CSS properties like border, width, padding, height, background-color, margin, etc
Tables have some special properties like border-spacing & border-collapse
Border Spacing
The border-spacing property specifies the distance between the borders of adjacent table cells

This property applies only when border-collapse is separate

We can use the same value for all sides

MDN border-spacing doc

Example:

table {
  border-spacing: 10px;
}
If we use 2 values we set the horizontal and vertical spacing

Example:

table {
  border-spacing: 10px 20px;
}
Border Collapse
The border-collapse CSS property specifies whether cells inside a table have shared or separate borders

Property values: collapse & separate

MDN border-collapse doc

Example:

table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
Practice
Exercise 17

Forms
We can use the CSS properties that we learned to styles our forms

Example:

input[type="text"] {
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  background-color: white;
  color: gray;
  font-size: 16px;
}

input.error {
  color: red;
  border-color: red;
}

input.success {
  color: green;
  border-color: green;
}

input[type="submit"] {
  display: block;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
  color: black;
  padding: 20px;
  font-weight: bold;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

input[type="submit"]:hover {
  background-color: #ddd;
  cursor: pointer;
}
<body>
  <form action="#">
    <input type="text" name="name">
    <input class="error" type="text" name="name">
    <input class="success" type="text" name="name">
    <input type="submit" value="Send Request">
  </form>
</body>

Exercise 18

Exercise 19

Layout
We can think about our web layout the same way designers design editorial layouts

Editorial design

Using a grid system with rows and columns we can create flexible layouts

This creates a better web design experience

Using CSS properties we can create a grid library

Some time ago we used to design sites 960px wide

Using this grid system we have 12 columns

Grid

If the row should be 960px wide then we can create 1 column and set the value to 12

In case we need 2 columns then each column can be 6 columns big

For 3 columns then each column will use 4 columns space

So we can think of our web design as rows and columns

Now in modern days we need these grids to be responsive as we need to support different screen resolutions

The number of columns may change depending the grid we use

Some examples of grid systems:

Unsemantic
Bootstrap
Foundation
Bootstrap

Position
The position property specifies how an element is positioned in a document
Property values:
static
relative
absolute
fixed
sticky
We'll use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to determine the final location of positioned element
MDN position doc
Static
This is the default value

The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document

The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect

Example:

div {
  position: static;
}
Relative
The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document

Then offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements

The space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static

This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is not auto

Example:

div {
  position: relative;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
Example:

div {
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: #eee;
}

div.relative {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  background-color: pink;
  border-color: red;
}
Relative position

Position Relative example

Practice
Exercise 20

Absolute
The element is removed from the normal document flow

No space is created for the element in the page layout

It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (if any), otherwise it is placed relative to the initial containing block

It's final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left

Absolutely positioned boxes can have margins, and they do not collapse with any other margins

Example:

  body {
    border: 2px solid orange;
  }
  div {
    border: 1px solid black;
    background-color: #eee;
  }

  div.absolute {
    position: absolute;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px;
    background-color: pink;
    border-color: red;
  }
Absolute position

Position Absolute example

In the previous example the absolute position is based on the body position as it's the parent element

Example:

body {
  border: 2px solid orange;
}

div {
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: #eee;
}

div.container {
  position: relative;
  height: 150px;
  background-color: green;
}

div.container .absolute {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  left: 50px;
  background-color: pink;
  border-color: red;
}
Absolute position

Position Absolute using container example

Now that we added a parent container the absolute element will get the initial position from the container element instead of the body

In some way we can say that using absolute position in this way is like creating a relative position between the parent and child element

To be able to create this type of layout we need to remember that the parent element must have a position:relative position

Example:

body {
  position: relative;
  border: 2px solid orange;
  height: 400px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 40px;
}

div.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 80px;
}

div.first {
  background-color: red;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  z-index: 1;
}

div.second {
  background-color: green;
  top: 60px;
  left: 60px;
  z-index: 2;
}
  <body>
    <div class="absolute first">First Div.</div>
    <div class="absolute second">Second Div</div>
  </body>
Absolute position

In this case we can use the z-index property to change the way elements will overlap

Position value: a number

Lower numbers are overlap]ped by higher ones

MDN z-index doc

Example:

div.first {
  z-index: 2;
}

div.second {
  background-color: green;
  top: 60px;
  left: 60px;
  z-index: 1;
}
Absolute position

Position Absolute z-index example

Practice
Exercise 21

Fixed
The element is removed from the normal document flow

No space is created for the element in the page layout

It is positioned relative to the screen's viewport and doesn't move when scrolled

Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left

Example:

div {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
Example:

body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0 50px 0 250px; 
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, #ddd, #111);
  
}

div {
  text-align: justify;  
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
}

.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #444;
  background-color: #ccc;
  color: #444;
  padding: 50px;
}
Fixed position

If we scroll down the static elements will follow the scroll flow

The fixed element is going to stay in the same possition

Fixed position

Position fixed example

Practice
Exercise 22

Sticky
The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document

Offset relative to its flow root and containing block based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements

By specification, will not work inside element with overflow: hidden or auto

Example:

div {
  position: sticky;
}
Example:

body {
  margin: 0;
  border: 1px solid orange;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  border: 2px solid black;
  background-color: #444;
  color: white;
  margin: 0;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  padding-left: 20px;
}

div {
  text-align: justify;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  padding: 0 20px;
}
In this example the h1 elements are positioned using a sticky value

Sticky position

As we scroll the document the browser will stick each h1 element to the same position

Sticky position

Each element is replaced if the section is over and there's other sticky elements

Sticky position

Position sticky example

Practice
Exercise 23

Float
Floats is a technique that allows the elements to float to the left or right of one another, rather than the default of sitting on top of one another

Property values: none, left & right

The main uses of floats are to lay out columns and float text around an image

MDN float doc

Example:

img {
  float: left;
}
Example:

img {
  border: 2px solid orange;
  margin: 20px 30px 20px 0;
}
By default if we add a image bettwen text it's going to look like this:

Float

If we float the element to the left the text can flow around it

Example:

img {
  float: left;
  border: 2px solid orange;
  margin: 20px 30px 20px 0;
}
Float

Float image example

We can use float with other elements to create a different layout

As we're going to float the elements we'll use the width property too

For example we can create a 2 column layout:

Example:

div {
  float: left;
  width: 50%;
}
Float

Float image example

In this example we float boath div elements to the left so each will position beside the other one

We set the width value to 50% so each of them will cover half of the parent container

When we float elements the parent container doesn't know the height of the elements

In this case we need to set a height to the parent element

Clear
The clear property specifies whether an element can be next to floating elements that precede it or must be moved down (cleared) below them

This property applies to both floating and non-floating elements

Property values: none, left, right & both

MDN clear doc

Example:

/* This way we remove any floating elements from both sides */
div {
  clear: both;
}
Example:

body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

div {
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: #eee;
  padding: 20px;
}

.floating {
  float: left;
  width: 30%;
}
  <body>
    <div class="floating">Floating Div</div>
    <div class="floating">Floating Div</div>
    <div class="clear">Figurative text</div>
  </body>

Media Query
Media query are a great way to apply CSS only to selected devices depending on their type or characteristics

For example we can apply CSS only when printing a document or if the device screen is bigger or smaller than a specific value

Using Media query we can make our site responsive

Grids system already helps us dealing with responsive design

Use the @media to specify a media query

To test different devices use the developers tools device mode

CSS Tricks - media queries for standard devices

Example:

@media print {
  /* This style will only be apply to print devices */
  div {

@media print {
  body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
  }
}
We can set the default values for all media types and then override the specific one

Media Print

Media Query print example

Also we can select devices by specific characteristics

Bootstrap for example uses the following configuration for different displays:

Extra small devices: Phones width < 768px
Small devices: Tablets width ≥768px
Medium devices: Desktops width ≥992px
Large devices: Desktops width ≥1200px
Example:

body {
  background-color: white;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 992px) {
  body {
    background-color: pink;
  }
}
We configure a couple of media query so the body background color will change deppending the device screen resolution

Use the and operator to add more than one rule

Media Query example

Also we can specify the device orientation using landscape or portrait as values

Example:

body {
  background-color: white;
}

@media only screen {
  /* iPhone X in landscape */ 
  @media (min-device-width : 375px) and (max-device-width : 812px)  and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio : 3) and (orientation : landscape) {
    body {
      background-color: yellow;
    }  
  }

  /* iPhone X in portrait */ 
  @media (min-device-width : 375px) and (max-device-width : 812px)  and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio : 3) and (orientation : portrait) {
    body {
      background-color: blue;
    }  
  }
}
To learn more about device orientation read the MDN Managing screen orientation guide

For mobile devices we need to add the following meta tag to scale the document

MDN responsive meta tag doc

Example:

<head>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
</head>
